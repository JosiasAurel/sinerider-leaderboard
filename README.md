# SineRider LeaderBoard

SineRider is a game about love and graphing, built by teenagers at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) and slated for release soon in 2023. This open-source project is powered by teenage hackers of all kinds: artists, musicians, programmers, storytellersâ€¦ so if that's you, come join us; we need your help to make this thing real!
